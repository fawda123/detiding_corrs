# Shiny app to assess correlation of tide and metabolism with changing window widths
This repository contains data and scripts for a Shiny web application to evaluate the effects of changing half-window widths on correlationS between tide and metabolim variables.  Correlations are based on values aggregated by month.  Dissolved oxygen is correlated with observed tidal height, production and respiration are correlated with mean tidal height change during day and night periods, respectively, and net ecosystem metabolism is correlated with mean daily tidal change for both day and night periods.
